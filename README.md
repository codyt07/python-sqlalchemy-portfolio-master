# SQL Alchemy Portfolio
Resume Flask Python Project
This project is a combination of what I accomplished at Treehouse. It showcases my projects, the skills I learned, and my contact information. 

To use this project, download the project files. $$$$

What I have learned in this project is combing Python, HTML, and SQL to display an interactive website. I can use the website to modify, add, and delete projects as I accomplish them.
