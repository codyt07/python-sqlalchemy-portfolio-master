# SQL Alchemy Portfolio
Resume Flask Python Project
This project is a combination of what I accomplished at Treehouse. It showcases my projects, the skills I learned, and my contact information. 

To use this project, download the project files and open the folder in your IDE of choice. Depending on which one you use, you may have to create a virtual environment. 
I recommend the following code to initiate the virtual environment:
python -m venv env
and to start the environment, enter the following into the terminal:
Mac: source ./env/bin/activate
Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate

After that, run "python app.py". I have the website URL default to 127.0.0.2:8000. Enter that URL in your browser of choice (there are issues with Safari and Firefox with the add project page), and you should be able to see the website from there.

What I have learned in this project is combing Python, HTML, and SQL to display an interactive website. I can use the website to modify, add, and delete projects as I accomplish them. 

Thank you for checking out my project!
