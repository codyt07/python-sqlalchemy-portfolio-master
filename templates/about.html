        <h2>Short Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I graduated from Middle Tennessee State University in 2015 with a Bachelor's of Behavioral and Health Sciences Degree.
            My main focus then was Criminal Justice with a concentration in Homeland Security. While I was a student there, I also
            911 police dispatched for MTSU.</p>
            <p>
            Fast forward a few years, and I am still working in the field of local law enforcement. Not only that, I am an
            instructor in a few different things such as tactical medical, DHS-FEMA Prevention and Response to Suicide Terrorist
            Bombing, and more. I have been in the public safety field for about seven years now.
        </p>
        <p>
            I originally majored in computer sciences but placed it on the back burner while pursuing criminal justice instead.
            However, I have always had an interest in technology. In High School, I learned how to automate robots for NISSAN
            through a course they offered. I also hobby around with LINUX desktops (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Garuda, to name a few). Now, I
            want to go into the IT field and create.
